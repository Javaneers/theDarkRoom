The stars broke through the clouds one summer night in the year 1952: a moment's reprieve
for our group of three travelers as we made our way through town and on our way to

did we know this might be the last time we saw each other. A whip of lightning spurred
us into action, sprinting in all directions. I went wherever my adrenaline told me to go.
Over crumbling walls, under barbed wire, then deeper and deeper into an abandoned building.
At first, it was just nice to be dry, but soon
