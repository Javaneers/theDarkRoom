Welcome to the Dark Room

In this text-based RPG, you are a Player in a Dark Room... A very Dark Room.
You will spawn in a room of unknown dimensions, which can be thought of as
A Game Board divided up into squares. You will be given a limited number of
Moves to navigate through the Dark Room, find the Escape Door, and make your
Escape. Follow the prompts for available actions. Submit your selection by
typing it into the console and then press 'Enter' or 'Return'.
